This is a fork of @thepoweroftwo 's app, with some support for v1.2 device firmware hacked in.  The device settings don't work, but the messaging does, and I added a map view.

I apologise for butchering your app @thepoweroftwo!  I understand others are working on this (and another) app, but I wanted to support my use case (mostly seeing node's locations on a map) and this was the quickest way to do it.  In the future, the other apps will probably end up better than this one.

Any help from testers and other iOS developers is appreciated.

- Set device config and owner information

## Roadmap
- Show time and date in chat messages
- Implement persistent storage
- Add a map with nearby devices
- Add QR-Code functionality
- Refine user interface
